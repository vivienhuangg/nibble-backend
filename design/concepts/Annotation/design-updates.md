# response:

Here are the contrasting major design changes from the `Annotation` concept specification to its implementation:

*   **Validation Logic Deferral:** The `annotate` action's `requires` clauses (e.g., `recipe exists`, `0 ≤ index < |target list|`) and the `resolveAnnotation` action's `requires` clause (`resolver canView annotation.recipe`) are explicitly deferred to "higher-level logic or syncs" in the implementation. This emphasizes the strict independence of the `Annotation` concept, ensuring it doesn't need to understand the internal structure of a `Recipe` or external user permissions.
*   **Addition of Explicit Queries:** The concept specification did not define any explicit query actions. The implementation adds `_getAnnotationsForRecipe` and `_getAnnotationById` methods to allow for direct retrieval of annotations, enhancing testability and practicality.
*   **Scope of Annotations:** Annotations are applied to base `Recipe` objects only. The originally planned `Version` concept (which would have created immutable snapshots of recipe modifications) was not implemented (see [Version/design-updates.md](../Version/design-updates.md)), so annotations remain associated with recipes rather than with specific versions.
