# response:

- **Nature of Implementation:** The concept specification describes `Ingredient` as a `concept`, implying it *could* be implemented as a standalone service with its own persistent state and actions. However, the implementation treats `Ingredient` purely as a **reusable data structure (TypeScript interface)**, intended to be embedded within other concepts (like `Recipe`), rather than a full concept class managing its own dedicated MongoDB collection and lifecycle.
- **State Management:** While the concept spec outlines `Ingredient`'s state, the implementation **does not create a dedicated MongoDB collection** for ingredients. Instead, `Ingredient` objects (defined by the interface) are stored as embedded sub-documents within the state of other concepts. **Note:** The `Version` concept mentioned in the spec was not implemented (see [Version/design-updates.md](../Version/design-updates.md)).
